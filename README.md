## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code analysis

## 📈 API Integration

### Gemini AI Integration
- Structured JSON responses with schema validation
- Market analysis and strategic insights
- Technology stack recommendations
- SWOT analysis generation

### Google Search API
- Competitor research with link validation

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on modern hosting platforms:

- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment
- **Netlify**: Static site hosting
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting solution

## 🧪 Jenkins CI

This repository now includes a root `Jenkinsfile` for continuous integration.

The pipeline performs these checks on every run:

1. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
2. Runs ESLint with `npm run lint`
3. Builds the production bundle with `npm run build`

The build does not require API keys because the app reads its `VITE_*` values at runtime in the browser. If you later add a CI step that needs secrets, store them in Jenkins credentials and inject them as environment variables.
